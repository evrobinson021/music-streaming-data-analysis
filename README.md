# Music Streaming Data Analysis (2024)

Welcome to my first data analysis project! This repository showcases my skills in data collection, processing, analysis, and visualisation using **Microsoft Excel** and **Power BI**. I created this project as a portfolio piece to demonstrate my capabilities as an aspiring data analyst.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyse and visualise data from the most streamed songs of 2024. The insights and dashboard I created highlight trends, artist performance, and listener preferences during the year.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Microsoft Excel**: Data cleaning, transformation, and preliminary analysis
- **Power BI**: Interactive dashboards, data modeling, and visualisation

## What I Did

- Collected and compiled streaming data for the top songs of 2024
- Cleaned and structured raw data in Excel for analysis
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and outliers
- Built interactive visualisations and dashboards in Power BI to present findings
- Summarised key insights and recommendations based on the analysis

## Key Insights

- The top artist for 2024 was The Weekend with his song Blinding Lights
- On Spotify, Blinding Lights was streamed on average 4,281.47 million times  
- The second highest song streamed was Ed Sheeran, Shape of You at an average of 3,909.46 million. Which tells us that *POP* was one of the most popular genres in 2024. 

## Getting Started
